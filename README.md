##Abstract

In this talk, we present some of the ideas behind the course on "DSLs of Mathematics (DSLM)", currently in preparation at Chalmers. We briefly show two examples of DSLs: calculus of derivatives and power series. An important theorem of complex analysis establishes a bridge between these languages when the underlying semantics is that of complex numbers. Translations between DSLs are fundamental in mathematics, they may be important to software engineering as well.
